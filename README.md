# Project4

# Description
The intent of this project is to create either an experience or game in three.js. Which of these I choose is still not determined as I am not sure what roadblocks I will encounter along the way, and how to properly scope for something I have never done before. I should know for sure about halfway through which of them I am doing, and will already have the foundation created. It will either be an interactive experience involving randomly generated planets and stars, or a game where you have to fight off aliens, and dodge asteroids. 

# MVP
- randomly generated stars
- planets
- ability to move the player / camera through space
- asteroids

# User Stories
- As a lover of space games, I want to be able to fight enemies and defend my home planet.
- As a person who enjoys adventure, I would enjoy being able to explore all types of planets that are always different.

* The theme of this project may still change, but the fundamental concept will still be the same
